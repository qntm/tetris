# Solving Tetris in C

This is the source code for <a href="https://qntm.org/tetris">a project I undertook in 2011</a> to determine whether or not it is always possible to get at least one line in Tetris.

## v2

This version of the code caches well results, runs like the blazes, and gives pretty output. The catch is, it uses all of your memory. Work on this branch was abandoned.
