# Solving Tetris in C

The is the source code for <a href="https://qntm.org/tetris">a project I undertook in 2011</a> to determine whether or not it is always possible to get at least one line in Tetris.

## main

This `main` branch has the code as it was around the time I ultimately abandoned the project around 2011. This branch is most similar to [the `v1` branch](https://github.com/qntm/tetris/tree/v1), as opposed to [the `v2` branch](https://github.com/qntm/tetris/tree/v2), which uses unlimited amounts of memory to cache intermediate results, and was abandoned as an impractical approach.
